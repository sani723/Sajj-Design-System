# Sajj Design System

## Description
Sajj Design System is a set of design rules development and design practice of building user interfaces with modular components. UIs are built from the “bottom up” starting with basic components then progressively combined to assemble screens.

## Development Approach
### Build one component at a time

Build each component in isolation and define its relevant states. Start small.
- Avatar
- Button
- Input
- Tooltip

### Combine components

Compose small components together to unlock new features while gradually increasing complexity.
- Form
- Header
- List
- Table

### Assemble pages

Build pages by combining composite components. Use mock data to simulate pages in hard-to-reach states and edge cases.
- Home page
- Settings page
- Profile page

### Integrate pages into your project

Add pages to your app by connecting data and hooking up business logic. This is when your UI meets your backend APIs and services.
- Web app
- Marketing site
- Docs site

## Benefits of Design System

1. **Quality:** Verify that UIs work in different scenarios by building components in isolation and defining their relevant states.

2. **Durability:** Pinpoint bugs down to the detail by testing at the component level. It’s less work and more precise than testing screens.

3. **Speed:** Assemble UIs faster by reusing existing components from a component library or design system.

4. **Efficiency:** Parallelize development and design by decomposing UI into discrete components then sharing the load between different team members.
